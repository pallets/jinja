Jinja2 Changelog
===============

Version 2.1
-----------
(codename to be selected, release date yet unknown)

- fixed a bug with nested loops and the special loop variable.  Before the
  change an inner loop overwrote the loop variable from the outer one after
  iteration.

- fixed a bug with the i18n extension that caused the explicit pluralization
  block to look up the wrong variable.

- fixed a limitation in the lexer that made ``{{ foo.0.0 }}`` impossible.

- index based subscribing of variables with a constant value returns an
  undefined object now instead of raising an index error.  This was a bug
  caused by eager optimizing.

- the i18n extension looks up `foo.ugettext` now followed by `foo.gettext`
  if an translations object is installed.  This makes dealing with custom
  translations classes easier.

- fixed a confusing behavior with conditional extending.  loops were partially
  executed under some conditions even though they were not part of a visible
  area.

- added `sort` filter that works like `dictsort` but for arbitrary sequences.

Version 2.0
-----------
(codename jinjavitus, released on July 17th 2008)

- the subscribing of objects (looking up attributes and items) changed from
  slightly.  It's now possible to give attributes or items a higher priority
  by either using dot-notation lookup or the bracket syntax.  This also
  changed the AST slightly.  `Subscript` is gone and was replaced with
  :class:`~jinja2.nodes.Getitem` and :class:`~jinja2.nodes.Getattr`.

  For more information see :ref:`the implementation details <notes-on-subscriptions>`.

- added support for preprocessing and token stream filtering for extensions.
  This would allow extensions to allow simplified gettext calls in template
  data and something similar.

- added :meth:`jinja2.environment.TemplateStream.dump`.

- added missing support for implicit string literal concatenation.
  ``{{ "foo" "bar" }}`` is equivalent to ``{{ "foobar" }}``

- `else` is optional for conditional expressions.  If not given it evaluates
  to `false`.

- improved error reporting for undefined values by providing a position.

- `filesizeformat` filter uses decimal prefixes now per default and can be
  set to binary mode with the second parameter.

- fixed bug in finalizer

Version 2.0rc1
--------------
(no codename, released on June 9th 2008)

- first release of Jinja2
