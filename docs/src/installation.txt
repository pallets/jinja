============
Installation
============

Jinja requires at least Python 2.3 to work correctly.

Installing a released version
=============================

As a Python egg (via easy_install)
----------------------------------

You can install the most recent Jinja version using `easy_install`_::

    sudo easy_install Jinja

This will install a Jinja egg in your Python installation's site-packages
directory.

From the tarball release
-------------------------

1.  Download the most recent tarball from the `download page`_
2.  Unpack the tarball
3.  ``sudo python setup.py install``

Note that the last command will automatically download and install
`setuptools`_ if you don't already have it installed. This requires a working
internet connection.

This will install Jinja into your Python installation's site-packages directory.

Installing the development version
==================================

If you want to play around with the code
----------------------------------------

1.  Install `mercurial`_
2.  ``svn co http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/jinja-main jinja``
3.  ``cd jinja``
4.  ``ln -s jinja /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages``

As an alternative to steps 4 you can also do ``python setup.py develop``
which will install the package via setuptools in development mode.

If you just want the latest features and use them
-------------------------------------------------

::
    
    sudo easy_install Jinja==dev

This will install a Jinja egg containing the latest Subversion trunk code
in your Python installation's site-packages directory. Every time the command
is run, the sources are updated from Subversion.

Documentation
=============

The egg builds include a documentation which is available in the ``docs`` folder
of the egg. If you're running linux you will find the documentation here::

    file:///usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages/Jinja-Y.Z-py2.X.egg/docs/index.html

where ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` must be replaced by the python / jinja version
number.
