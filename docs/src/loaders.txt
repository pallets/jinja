Developing Loaders
==================

Template loaders are just normal Python classes that have to provide some
functions used to load and translate templates. Because some of the tasks
a loader has to do are redundant there are some classes that make loader
development easier.

Here the implementation of a simple loader based on the `BaseLoader` from
`jinja.loaders`:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import codecs
    from os.path import join
    from jinja.loaders import BaseLoader
    from jinja.exceptions import TemplateNotFound

    class SimpleLoader(BaseLoader):
        
        def __init__(self, path):
            self.path = path

        def get_source(self, environment, name, parent):
            filename = join(self.path, name)
            if not path.exists(filename):
                raise TemplateNotFound(name)
            f = codecs.open(filename, 'r', environment.template_charset)
            try:
                return f.read()
            finally:
                f.close()

The functions `load` and `parse` which are a requirement for a loader are
added automatically by the `BaseLoader`.

Additionally to the `BaseLoader` there is a mixin class called
`CachedLoaderMixin` that implements memory and disk caching of templates.
Note that you have to give it a higher priority in the MRO than the
`BaseLoader` which means that's the first base class when inheriting from it:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import codecs
    from os.path import join, getmtime, exists
    from jinja.loaders import BaseLoaderCachedLoaderMixin
    from jinja.exceptions import TemplateNotFound

    class CachedLoader(CachedLoaderMixin, BaseLoader):
        
        def __init__(self, path):
            self.path = path
            CachedLoaderMixin.__init__(
                True,       # use memory caching
                40,         # for up to 40 templates
                '/tmp',     # additionally save the compiled templates in /tmp
                True        # and reload cached templates automatically if changed
            )

        def get_source(self, environment, name, parent):
            filename = join(self.path, name)
            if not path.exists(filename):
                raise TemplateNotFound(name)
            f = codecs.open(filename, 'r', environment.template_charset)
            try:
                return f.read()
            finally:
                f.close()

        def check_source_changed(self, environment, name):
            fn = join(self.path, name)
            if exists(fn):
                return getmtime(fn)
            return 0

You don't have to provide the `check_source_changed` method. If it doesn't
exist the option `auto_reload` won't have an effect. Also note that the
`check_source_changed` method must not raise an exception if the template
does not exist but return ``0``.
