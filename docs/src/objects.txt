Global objects
==============

This section covers the behavior of global objects in the Jinja namespace and
also the behavior of their attributes.

Functions
=========

`Filters`_ and `Tests`_ are special kind of functions you cannot call without
and argument. Global functions are different. Those are really just ordinary
python functions. You can register them on the global namespace easily:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def my_function():
        return [1, 2, 3]

    env.globals['my_function'] = my_function

In the template you can not call it like this:

.. sourcecode:: jinja

    {{ my_function() }}

Of couse you can pass any argument to it. But what if you want to access the
context or environment? In that case you have to decorate a function or mark
it (both work exactly the same, but the decorator way is probably nicer if you
have python >= 2.4):

.. sourcecode:: python

    from cgi import escape
    from pprint import pformat
    from jinja.datastructure import contextcallable

    @contextcallable
    def printcontext(env, context):
        result = []
        for key, value in context.to_dict():
            result.append('<tr><th>%s</th><td>%r</td></tr>' %
                          (escape(unicode(key)), escape(pformat(value))))
        return '<table>%s</table>' % u'\n'.join(result)

If this function is registered in the environment namespace then and called
from the template it should return the content of the context as simple html
template. Of course you can modify the context too. For more informations about
the context object have a look at the `context object`_ documentation.

Deferred Values
===============

You can pass functions to the template that are called to provide values at
first access. Say you want to pass the list of recently written comments to
all templates. But not necessarily every template will render that. In that
situation you can create a function that returns that value and wrap it in an
`Deferred` object. The first time a template accesses the variable then the
`Deferred` object is resolved:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from jinja.datastructure import Deferred
    from yourapplication.models import Comments

    def get_recent_comments(env, context, name):
        # do what ever you want here.
        return Comments.get_recent(10)

    env.globals['recent_comments'] = Deferred(get_recent_comments)

The function is always called with the same arguments. The first one is the
current environment, the second the context and the third is the name of the
variable. In this example ``recent_comments``.

Unsafe Methods / Attributes
===========================

Because Jinja is sandboxed it provides several ways to prevent unsafe attribute
access. You can mark both attributes and methods as unsafe:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from jinja.datastructure import unsafe

    class MyModel(...):

        # just give access to a and b. Default is all
        jinja_allowed_attributes = ['a', 'b']

        def __init__(self, ...):
            ...
            self.a = ...
            self.b = ...

        # python2.4 way of marking methods
        @unsafe
        def save(self):
            """Save the model."""

        # python2.3 way for the same
        def delete(self):
            """Delete the model."""
        delete.jinja_unsafe_call = True
